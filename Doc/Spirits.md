This doc will attempt to give a semi-clear description of most spirit-related things in the mod.

# Spiritwalkers

Spiritwalkers are generally otherwise average humans that were born with (or gained) the ability to communicate with the spirits of nature, willingly or not, which is why some spiritwalkers have to pick between isolating themselves or going insane from the voices of nearby spirits and animals invading their head. Some choose to harness the power of a single spirit, some multiple. Their look generally changes to have more beastial-like features the more experience and control they have over invoking that spirit. Most spirits, however, are unpredictable beings that are just as likely to help you as they are to harm you, which is why spiritwalkers that tap too deep into the nature of their chosen spirit, or are too weak to handle it, go completely mad and are consumed by it instead.
Sorted by experience level, they are:
## Spirit acolytes:
generally the lowest level, slightly better than an average human with no spirit communication capabilities. They're usually able to tap into a spirit's nature, gaining mild boosts to their physical or mental capabilities.
## Spiritwalkers:
Spirit acolytes who've invoked and gained experience with the spirits. Alongside physical and mental boosts, they're able to harness the spirit itself, granting them various weapons, tools or other physical objects depending on the spirit.
## Avatars:
Spiritwalkers who've dedicated themselves to a single spirit and gained enough experience to be able to summon the true manifestation of it. Alongside the previous effects, they're able to temporarily become one with their chosen spirit, gaining much better physical/mental capabilities, enhanced physical manifestations and their bodies often change according to the spirit in question. Note that avatars may still harness and tap into other spirits, but can only become the avatar of the spirit they've chosen to dedicate themselves to.

# Spirits

The spirits change from region to region. Some embody animals and some embody values, ethics or certain traits. Their power depends on the amount of people that believe in them, and so they have greatly weakened after the cataclysm and have become more willing to offer their power to those that request it in hopes of finding one that would restore them to their full strength. These include but are not limited to:

## The four animal spirits:
These are the animal/trait spirits of nature that most spiritwalkers learn to call upon first, intentionally or otherwise.
- The Tiger : Spirit of fury
- The Turtle : Spirit of resiliance
- The Bear : Spirit of might
- The Lynx : Spirit of wisdom
## The four spirit-sisters:
Animal spirits who depict traits otherwise found in nature. They're lesser known than the four basic spirits and so less spiritwalkers channel them.
- The Boar : Spirit of earth
- The Seal : Spirit of water
- The Raven : Spirit of air
- The Phoenix : Spirit of fire
## The spirits of the cycle:
Spirits who take the form of animals and represent the cycle of life and death.
- The Jackal : Spirit of death
- The Coyote : Spirit of life
## The spirit of destruction:
Long forgotten and only known by the most experienced spiritwalkers who dare not even call upon a slither of its power.
- The Dragon: Spirit of wrath and pride
